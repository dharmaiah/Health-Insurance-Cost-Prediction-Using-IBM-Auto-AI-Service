# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Using-IBM-Auto-AI-Service
Project Description:  In this project, we study the effects of age, smoking, BMI, gender, and region to determine how much of a difference these factors can make on your insurance premium. By using our application, customers see the radical difference their lifestyle choices make on their insurance charges. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, we help customers understand just how much smoking increases their premium by predicting how much they will have to pay within seconds.  To build this project we will be using  IBM AutoAI.You create a model from a data set that includes the age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking preferences, region, and charges to predict the health insurance premium cost that an individual pays.
